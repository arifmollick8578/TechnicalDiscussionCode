# TechnicalDiscussionCode

The codes are not finalized and production ready. There are lots of pending works which I can modify and update such as:
- Provides instance using DI, instead of passing them directly
- Structures the codes using different package format
- Can updates code using SOLID principle
- Proper UI rendering using Fragment and RecyclerView
- Local cache
